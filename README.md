# Overview

This project is a Social Media website made with React. It contains multiple pages such a a login, register, home and profile page. The application is not currently a full stack website as of now but will be in the future.
The application is built using react-router-dom and react hooks.  
The website shows only the front-end with a few functionalities such as:
* Light and Dark theme when clicking the moon or sun button

* Logging out when clicking the person button (Temporary)
* Able to click to your profile (but no editing)
* Respnsive layout (mobile and tablet friendly

## How to view
The application does not let you see the any pages others than the login/registraion page unless you are signed in. Because app is only used to showcase web design and styling as of now, you can only log in as myself.
* To do this click the login button and you will be logged in. No information will be recorded when clicking the log in button or when registrating.  
* You can view the profile page by clicking on the names of the profile.  
* To logout of the site click the person icon on the right of the navbar, this will change in the future but for easy testing it's there.  

In the future I will connect the site to a database to have full functioning application 
but for now the site is for display only.

## Futures implementations:
* Make a database to register users
* Functionality to post pictures or text posts
* Add a function to comment on people's post
* Add a fucntionality to follow and unfollow people
* Edit profile box (name, location and website)
